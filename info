1. Bootstrap
   Utilized:
   You are using Bootstrap for layout and styling.
   Evidence:
   The use of classes like container, row, col-lg-6, col-lg-12, dropdown, and nav indicates that you are leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and components.
   The inclusion of bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js confirms Bootstrap is being used.
2. FontAwesome
   Utilized:
   You are using FontAwesome for icons.
   Evidence:
   The <i class="fa fa-shopping-bag"></i> in your HTML indicates that FontAwesome icons are being used.
   The inclusion of fontawesome.css confirms this.
3. jQuery
   Utilized:
   You are using jQuery for JavaScript functionality.
   Evidence:
   The inclusion of jquery.min.js suggests that jQuery is being used.
   However, no specific jQuery code is visible in the provided snippets. If you are not using any jQuery-specific functions, this might be unnecessary.
4. Custom CSS
   Utilized:
   You are using your own custom CSS for styling.
   Evidence:
   The inclusion of style.css indicates that you have written custom styles for your project.
5. Owl Carousel
   Not Utilized:
   The owl.css file is commented out, and there is no evidence of Owl Carousel classes (e.g., .owl-carousel) in your HTML.
6. Animate.css
   Not Utilized:
   The animate.css file is commented out, and there are no animation-related classes (e.g., animated, fadeIn) in your HTML.
7. Swiper.js
   Not Utilized:
   The Swiper.js stylesheet (swiper-bundle.min.css) is commented out, and there is no evidence of Swiper.js components (e.g., .swiper-container) in your HTML.
8. PHP
   Utilized:
   You are using PHP extensively for server-side logic.
   Evidence:
   Session management (session_start()).
   Database queries using mysqli_query() to fetch and update user data.
   Conditional rendering of HTML based on session variables (e.g., if (isset($\_SESSION['valid']))).
9. MySQL
   Utilized:
   You are using MySQL as your database.
   Evidence:
   Queries like SELECT \* FROM users WHERE id='$id' and UPDATE users SET ... indicate interaction with a MySQL database.
10. JavaScript
    Partially Utilized:
    You are using JavaScript for basic functionality.
    Evidence:
    The setTimeout function for delayed redirection.
    However, there is no evidence of advanced JavaScript frameworks or libraries being used.

Summary of Frameworks and Libraries Utilized

Recommendation
Remove unused libraries like owl.css, animate.css, and swiper-bundle.min.css if you are not planning to use them.
If you are not using jQuery-specific functionality, consider removing it to reduce unnecessary dependencies.
