1. ../vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js
   Purpose: This is the jQuery library, which is required for many plugins and custom scripts.
   Usage in Your Code:
   The counter.js file uses jQuery ($.fn.countTo).
   If any other scripts (e.g., isotope.min.js, owl-carousel.js) depend on jQuery, this file is necessary.
   Conclusion: Used. Keep this file.
2. ../vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js
   Purpose: This is the JavaScript file for Bootstrap, which provides interactive components like modals, dropdowns, and carousels.
   Usage in Your Code:
   If your project uses Bootstrap components (e.g., dropdowns in the navigation menu), this file is required.
   Your navigation menu includes a dropdown (<li class="dropdown">), so this file is likely necessary.
   Conclusion: Used. Keep this file.
3. ../assets/js/isotope.min.js
   Purpose: Isotope is a JavaScript library for filtering and sorting grid layouts.
   Usage in Your Code:
   There is no visible code in your project that initializes or uses Isotope (e.g., $('.grid').isotope()).
   If you are not using grid layouts with filtering/sorting, this file is unnecessary.
   Conclusion: Not Used. You can remove this file unless you plan to use Isotope in the future.
4. ../assets/js/owl-carousel.js
   Purpose: Owl Carousel is a JavaScript library for creating responsive carousels/sliders.
   Usage in Your Code:
   There is no visible code in your project that initializes or uses Owl Carousel (e.g., $('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel()).
   If you are not using a carousel/slider, this file is unnecessary.
   Conclusion: Not Used. You can remove this file unless you plan to use Owl Carousel in the future.
5. ../assets/js/counter.js
   Purpose: This file provides a jQuery plugin ($.fn.countTo) for animating number counters.
   Usage in Your Code:
   There is no visible code in your project that initializes or uses the countTo plugin (e.g., $('.counter').countTo()).
   If you are not using animated counters, this file is unnecessary.
   Conclusion: Not Used. You can remove this file unless you plan to use animated counters in the future.
6. ../assets/js/custom.js
   Purpose: This file is typically used for custom JavaScript specific to your project.
   Usage in Your Code:
   Without seeing the contents of custom.js, it’s unclear if it is being used.
   Check if this file contains any custom scripts that are required for your project.
   Conclusion: Potentially Used. Review the contents of this file to confirm.
